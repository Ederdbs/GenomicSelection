### Code for run simulation, full study in paper: Impact of genomic prediction model, selection intensity and
 breeding strategy on the long-term genetic gain and genetic erosion in soybean breeding
## Author: Eder David Borges da Silva, Alencar Xavier and Marcos Ventura Farias.

Run the code:
1) open file GS_MultiRunFZ.R, install any packager necessary
2) all settings can be change in this file for create a new scenario
3) Run all the script GS_MultiRunFZ
* Results are settings for this models and selection intensity layout in graphics, please if change or add more, review this script for better results. 
* the code is optimize to run in Windows and Linux, for Windows run in parallel by default in 6 cores (can be change) and for Linux is optimize for cluster environment, please see code in GS_Function.R for more detail about your environmental 
Enjoy the code!!!!!!
